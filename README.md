To connect an internal SATA DVD drive to a raspberry pi, I am using
this:

The important part is that the adapter takes external 12V power so it
isn't trying to power the DVD drive from the Pi's USB port.

For scratch storage, either use USB thumb stick or a SATA SSD/HDD
attached via another SATA->USB converter. Powering a SATA SSD from the
USB power seems to work just fine.
